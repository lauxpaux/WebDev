<h2>The Yurts at Montclair Trails</h2>



<p>
    <h4>What is a yurt?</h4>
    Our luxury yurts are permament structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt has canvas walls, 
    a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened. Sounds real nice. 
</p>




<p>
    <h4>How are the yurts furnished?</h4>
    Must I type all of this? Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size (should be king, in my opinion) bed
    with down quilt and gas-fired stove-- that sounds nice, my electric stove takes <i>forever</i> to heat up.
    The luxury camping experience also includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water (I mean
    these are basic amenities, no?). Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.
</p>

<p>
    <h4>What shoudl I bring?</h4>
    Bring a sense of adventure and some time to relax! Unless you're a developer and have trouble disassociating 
    with your work, then bring your laptop! Most guests also pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress
    for changing weather with layers of clothing. Also, bring chips!
