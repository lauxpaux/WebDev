 <tr><th>Physics and Astronomy</th></tr> 
 <tr>
      <td id="physicDept">One of the oldest academic disciplines, physics is a natural science whose goal is to understand how everything works at its most fundamental level. Physicists study 
          nature on scales as small as an atomic nucleus to as large as the observable universe. Physics is the cornerstone of the other natural sciences (chemistry, geology, biology, astronomy)
           and is essential to understanding our modern technological society. At the heart of physics is a combination of experiment, observation and the analysis of phenomena using mathematical 
           and computational tools.
